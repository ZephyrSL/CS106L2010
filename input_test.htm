This article will explain firstly why, when and how to split
your C source code between several files sensibly, and it will
then go on to show you how the GNU Make utility can handle all
your compilation and linking automatically. Users of other make
utilities may still find the information useful, but it may
require some adaptation to work on other utilities. If in doubt,
try it out, but check the manual first.
